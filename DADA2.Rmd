```{r}
library(dada2); packageVersion("dada2")
```
In this line we indicate rstudio that we want to work with the external package DADA2

```{r}
path <- "/home/rstudio/DADA2/MiSeq_SOP"
list.files(path)
```
We named the path to specify a folder where the files that you want to list are located
The list.files() function is to return a vector containing all the files names that are in our path
